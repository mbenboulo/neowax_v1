          The long-term vision for Neowax Incubator is to see affordable, robust
          incubators become standard equipment in clinics and facilities that
          currently have none. By closing this gap, we can help reduce
          preventable neonatal deaths and give premature infants a stronger
          chance at survival and healthy development.

          Beyond individual devices, the project aims to foster collaboration
          among engineers, clinicians, and global health partners to continually
          improve the design and adapt it to local needs. Future work may
          include integrating monitoring tools, refining transport modules, and
          supporting training programs for frontline staff.
